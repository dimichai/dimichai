### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dimitris, a PhD student at the Civic AI Lab of the University of Amsterdam.

My current research focus is on using Reinforcement Learning to explore the dynamics of urban mobility, identify inequalities and design urban systems to alleviate them.

I am also developing [Greece in Figures](http://greeceinfigures.com/), an organization that aims to explain complex socioeconomic phenomena in simple words & clean graphs, for the Greek audience.

I used to create interactive data stories on society and culture and post them on my blog [Thousand Words](https://www.thousandwords.gr/).
This idea has now been evolved into [100 Europeans](https://www.100europeans.org/), an organization that aims to raise awareness around the big challenges of our time by breaking them down into relatable, interactive and visual stories, in which Europe is a community of just 100 people. 100 Europeans recently won 2nd prize at the [EU Datathon 2022](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon) final in Brussels. 

You can find more information about me on my [website](https://dimichai.github.io/).
